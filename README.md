# Module-09-Assignment

## How to Run

**Run the Program**: Execute the `Module09Assignment` class to run the garment simulator.

## Extending the Simulator

1.  I defined a New Interface by adding a new type of garment, I defined a new interface similar to `Top`, `Pant`, or `Shoe`.
2. I implemented the Interface by creating concrete classes for the new garment or variant.
3. I updated the Factory by adding methods in the factory interface and concreting factory classes to create the new garment or variant.
